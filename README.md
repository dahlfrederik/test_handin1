### 1.2. ALIEN  

**Describtion**

An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. 

Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)

**Step to step guide for alien brushing teeth**

1. Pick up toothbrush from the mug; placed to the right of the sink. Move your hand to the toothbrush, bend your fingers excluding the thumb on the right side of the toothbrush and your thumb to the left of the brush. Establish that you got a grip on the toothbrush. 
2. Pick up toothpaste by; closing your hand around the toothpaste container, open the lid on the toothpaste by griping the top and pushing backwards, squeeze the toothpaste container & apply toothpaste to the brush end of the toothbrush by lifting the toothpaste container to the toothbrush. 
3. Open your mouth by; contracting your face muscles, keep your tounge in the back of the mouth. 
4. Put toothbrush in mouth by; moving your hand with the toothbrush in it so the hand is leveled with your open mouth. Move hand towards face so the brush end of toothbrush goes into the mouth. 
5. Start using the brush on the teeth; move your hand in small circular rotations, push the brush down on your teeth. Keep moving the brush around in your mouth so that every tooth is targeted. 
6. Brush lower and upper teeth set; change the angle and direction of the toothbrush by rotation the handle grip in your hand using your fingers. 
7. Repeat process for 2 to 3 minutes.

## 3. GIVE YOUR THOUGHS ON BDD 

1. What was positive and good about using BDD?
	- Writing BDD helped getting the wished behaviour and working on the results "use case" by use case. 
2. What was annoying or difficult?
	- In small trivial task likes this it seemed a bit overkill. 
	- But I gotta admit I got a better overview of getting the wished test coverage. For an example: error handling. 
3. What surprised you?
	- The mindsset you have to get into was a bit tougher than anticipated. 
4. Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more
	- For sure, I had to look more into it since I was working based on the results and not code. If that make sense. 
5. Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?
	- Yes, especially error handling. For a small project like this I might had "forgotten" to do error handling otherwise.
